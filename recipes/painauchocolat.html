                    <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Pour water into a bread machine pan; add flour. Sprinkle milk powder over flour. Place sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons of softened butter into the corners of the pan. Make a small indent in the top of the dry ingredients and place yeast in the indent. Run the bread machine on the basic dough setting.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, lay out a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Shape the remaining 1/2 cup of butter into a 3x5-inch rectangle on the waxed paper; wrap and chill until ready to use.</li>
                    <li>Remove butter from the refrigerator and allow to soften while you roll out dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; roll into a 8x12-inch rectangle. Place butter on half of the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border of dough on 3 sides. Fold the other half of dough over butter and press the edges firmly to seal.</li>
                    <li>Roll the dough out to a 6x14-inch rectangle. Fold the dough in thirds from the long ends, as you would fold a business letter. Cover dough loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Place it onto a lightly floured surface so that the folded edge faces you. Roll the dough out again into a 6x14-inch rectangle, and fold into thirds. Cover with plastic and chill for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Repeat step 5, then chill the dough for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, beat together the egg yolk and milk; set aside. Grease two baking sheets.</li>
                    <li>Roll dough out into a 12x21-inch rectangle. Cut dough into thirds in both directions, to make 9 rectangles. Divide chocolate among the rectangles. Lightly brush egg yolk mixture around the edges of each piece. Starting at a short end, roll each piece of dough around the chocolate; press the edges together to seal.</li>
                    <li>Place the croissants onto the prepared baking sheets; cover with greased plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until they have doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F [200 degrees C]. Brush the top of the pastries with the remaining egg yolk mixture.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer croissants to wire racks. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
