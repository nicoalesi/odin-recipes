                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F [165 degrees C].</li>
                    <li>To make the cheesecake layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition.</li>
                    <li>Spread 1 cup batter in the graham cracker crust.</li>
                    <li>To make the pumpkin layer: Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to the remaining batter; stir gently until well blended.</li>
                    <li>Carefully spread on top of plain cheesecake batter in the crust.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are puffed and the surface is firm except for a small spot in the center that jiggled when the pan is gently shaken, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, preferably overnight.</li>
                </ol>
