                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert made of layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, rich mascarpone cheese, cocoa powder, and a hint of rum or liqueur. Its creamy texture and bold coffee flavor are perfectly balanced with a dusting of cocoa on top, making it a beloved treat that combines <em>sweetness</em> and a touch of bitterness in every bite.</p>
                <p>The ladyfingers, soaked in strong espresso or liqueur, are paired with a velvety mascarpone mixture that includes eggs, sugar, and often a hint of vanilla. The dessert is typically chilled to let the flavors meld, creating a luxurious, <em>melt-in-your-mouth</em> texture. Sometimes, a touch of cocoa or chocolate shavings is added for extra depth.</p>
